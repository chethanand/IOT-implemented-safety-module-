This project is a safety module which operates by detecting the scream and heart rate(BPM) of the person who are using it and send the sms and GPS location of the user when they are in danger to their relative or friends number.

THE COMPONENTS ARE:

  LM393 - For sound detection
  
  NEO 6M GPS - For tracking GPS Location
  
  Pulse sensor - For detecting the Heart rate of the user(BPM)
  
  Buzzer - For telling the user that abnormal sound or heart rate(BPM) and proceed to the next step
  
  SIM 800L or SIM800A - For sending the SMS to their user's SOS number

HOW THIS WORKS:

  The Safety IoT Module detects abnormal conditions like loud sounds or high heart rate using sensors. If triggered, it activates a buzzer for alert and uses a GPS module to fetch the location. The SIM800A GSM module then sends an SOS message with the GPS location or makes an emergency call to a predefined number. This ensures rapid communication during emergencies.
